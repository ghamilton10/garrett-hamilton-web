<h1>Welcome to my website.</h1>
<h2>This website was created at the beginning of 2025 as a personal project.</h2>
<p>I needed something to work on to brush up on my skills, but I also needed something to present to potential employers to prove my competency with web development. This led to 
    the creation of this website. I am using this as a learning experience so that I may keep my skills sharp but also dig deeper into web development and learn more than my college
    education taught me. Eventually I would like to move this project towards being a full-stack web app, calling on my experience working with REST and node.js, among other technologies,
    to deliver a modern web application.

    Currently, this website is built on HTML and CSS, using JavaScript for interactive features.
